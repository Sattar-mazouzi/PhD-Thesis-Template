  abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive optimization approach for a fuzzy logic-based energy management system (EMS) designed for a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV) powered by a fuel cell and a battery. The aim is to enhance EMS performance and overall system efficiency by optimizing fuzzy logic parameters using a genetic algorithm (GA). The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through simulations using ADVISOR software and the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The optimization process consists of four phases: tuning the membership function types, fuzzy variable ranges, membership function parameters, and rule weights. The proposed method has resulted in a significant improvement in the fitness function, highlighting the high sensitivity of the fuzzy logic system to optimization parameters. The optimized EMS is compared with the original one and a thermostat-based strategy built into ADVISOR. Results show a 28.5\% improvement in fuel utilization and a 13\% reduction in the low-efficiency operation of the fuel cell system.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing reliable and efficient fuel-cell electric vehicles in the transportation and automotive sectors focusing on optimizing fuel economy and power distribution between the fuel cell and energy storage system, This paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based energy control strategy for fuel cell/battery hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV). The system takes the vehicle's required power and state of charge of the energy storage system as inputs and outputs the amount of power to be supplied to the power train by the fuel cell system, To evaluate the system's performance, the vehicle was designed and simulated using ADVISOR software, and the system was tested for three driving cycles and compared with the original energy management system. The proposed system showed improvement in fuel economy.},
